        question:"How long will it take to build my course?",
        answer:"This answer varies based on the type of course. We can create most courses in 60 days or less. A simple, five-module course could be done in 15 days, whereas big high-ticket courses take between 6 to 8 weeks on average.We’re able to work with most deadlines, so let’s talk to see what’s possible for your needs."
    },

    {
        question:"Who gets the rights to the final course?",
        answer:"You do! We sign a release at the end of the project, and the course is 100% yours, with all earnings going directly to you. We’re also happy to sign an NDA as we’re working on your course if you’d like. "
    },

    {
        question:"What experience(s) do I need?",
        answer:"You just need to be able to explain to us what you do and your goals. Our role is to expand upon creating your coursework, outline, ppt, slide decks, etc. There are a few approaches to this that we’d be glad to discuss!"
    },

    {
        question:"What will I have to create on my end?",
        answer:"This is another thing that varies, and it depends on the gig you order, but you don’t have to create anything.We can plan it, design it, create, and put everything into production. HOWEVER, most of our clients are the face of their course. You don’t need prior experience—we’ll do all the heavy work."
    },
    {
        question:"Can you build upon my existing product?",
        answer:"Yes, we can! If you’ve already started a course, have a book, workshop, blog, podcast, YouTube channel, etc., we can transform it into a profitable online course."
    },
    {
        question:"What if I’m still not sure I’m ready?",
